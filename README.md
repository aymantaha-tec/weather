I'm excited to share my latest project with you - a simple weather forecast site that I developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API, and AJAX! With this site, you can easily check the weather in your area and get up-to-date information on temperature, humidity, and wind direction.


Using my skills in front-end web development and API integration, I was able to create a responsive and user-friendly website that fetches real-time weather data from a reliable source. The use of AJAX allows for seamless updates of the weather data without refreshing the page, providing an enhanced user experience.
